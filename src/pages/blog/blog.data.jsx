        content: `Advertising allows you to specifically target your ideal customers with personalized messages which resonate with them. \n

        Advertising adds credibility to your message - repeatedly seeing your ads can reinforce your brand in consumers minds. \n
       
       How much are you spending on aquisition of a new customer?  \n
       
       The average allocation usually ranges between 9-12% of the annual budget, while the smallest businesses may go as low as 2%. \n
       
       If you spend $1 towards your marketing, what do you expect to make back? \n
       
       Smart campaigns help you track the number of times people saw your ad and then clicked your business' pin on Google Maps or got directions to your business . \n
       
       In this example,  \n
       
       Marketing budget: $300  \n
       
       If 50% of the 1,257 customers converted : \n
       = 629 customers \n
       
       If 629 customers spent $5 each : \n
       = $3143.00 \n
       
       ROI : \n
       = for every $1 spent, my client made back $10.48 \n
